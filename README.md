## Project Overview

This project aimed to predict hand gestures using arm EMG signals and a MediaPipe model. The intended workflow was as follows:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Place EMG sensors on the arm and simultaneously record EMG signals while capturing hand gestures with a camera. 
2. **Data Processing:** Align the EMG signals with hand keypoint coordinates extracted by MediaPipe for training purposes.
3. **Model Training:** Train a model to identify the relationship between EMG signals and hand gestures.
4. **Gesture Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict hand gestures based on real-time EMG signal acquisition.

However, due to challenges in acquiring and processing arm EMG signals, as well as an overly simplistic project scope, this project ultimately faced setbacks.
